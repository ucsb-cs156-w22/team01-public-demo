## About this repo

This is a minimal backend only webapp built with Spring Boot.

The app provides some sample code for an API, and a Swagger user interface
to test that API.  The API is essentially a proxy for another API.

This code is the basis for a programming exercise where each student on a
team of up to 6 students can build a proxy similar to the one in the example code.

## What can you do with this code?

| Command | What it does   |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `mvn compile` | Should result in a clean compile |
| `mvn test` | Runs JUnit tests on the code base |
| `mvn test jacoco:report` | Runs JUnit tests, and if all tests pass, computes code coverage.  The code coverage report (Jacoco) can be found in `target/site/jacoco/index.html` |
| `mvn package` | Builds the jar file `target/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar` |
| `mvn spring-boot:run` | Runs the code to startup a web server.  Access it via `http://localhost:8080` on the *same machine* where the server is running.  Use CTRL/C to stop it. |
| `java -jar target/demo-spring-backend-1.0.0.jar` | If done after `mvn package`, this is another way to start up the web server.|
| `mvn test org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` | Run [pitest mutation coverage](https://pitest.org).  View `target/pit-reports/index.html` for results (may take a few minutes)|
